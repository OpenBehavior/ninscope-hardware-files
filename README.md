### Computer requirements

We recommend using a laptop with SSD drive for respectively mobility and optimal disk write speeds. Despite this we have tested operating NINscope on a variety of systems including a MacBook Pro laptop running MacOS Mojave (R2015, i7, SSD), Mac Mini running MacOS Mojave (R2014, i5, 5400 rpm HD), Dell PC running Windows 7, or 10 (i7, 7200 rpm HD??) and a Linux Workstation running Ubuntu 18.04 (Intel Xeon, SSD), a PC running Ubuntu 18.04 (i5, HD??).
