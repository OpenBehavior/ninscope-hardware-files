### Assembly of optics

The assembly of optics resembles that of the first-gen. UCLA miniscope, with a few differences. First the emission and dichroic optical filters are 500 µm and therefore thinner and more fragile. The emission filter of 1000 µm thickness is glued on to the plano-convex lens with optical bonding glue (NOA81, Norland Products) and lowered into the lower half of the NINscope housing. 

### Cleaning of CMOS sensor

In case of dust particles or other particulates dropping on the CMOS sensor one can use 'Sticky Swabs' (ideal-tek, https://www.ideal-tek.com/public/doc/Sticky-swabs-leaflet_Ideal-tek.pdf) to remove them without causing damage to the sensor.

### Computer requirements

We recommend using a laptop with SSD drive for respectively mobility and optimal disk write speeds. Despite this we have tested operating NINscope on a variety of systems including a MacBook Pro laptop running MacOS Mojave (R2015, i7, SSD), Mac Mini running MacOS Mojave (R2014, i5, 5400 rpm HD), Dell PC Z240 running Windows 7(i7, NVMe SSD Samsung MZVLW256) or a NUC7i5BNH running Windows 10 (i5, SSD Crucial MX500) and a Linux Workstation running Ubuntu 18.04 (Intel Xeon, SSD), a Dell PC OPtiPlex 3050 SFF running Ubuntu 18.04 (i5, SSD).
